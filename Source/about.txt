BigFile (c) 2022 - De Bitmanager (https://bitmanager.nl)

BigFile is inspired by Woanware's LogViewer (https://github.com/woanware/LogViewer)
Unfortunately BigFile diverged way too far from the original logviewer, so I decided it deserves its own place.

The biggest changes are:
- Very fast loading/searching 
- Loading of .gz / .zip files
- In memory loading
- For large files (15GB is large?) memory compression is used.
- Encoding can be changed dynamically
- Searches can contain boolean expressions
- Multi-threaded search, as well as caching previous searches
- Super fast grid that supports 2 billion rows (the ListView stopped at 100M)

The project can be downloaded from https://github.com/pweerd/bigfile
